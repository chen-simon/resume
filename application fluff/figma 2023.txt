I have used Figma before, and am very impressed with the level of quality and user friendliness that it provides. From using it to prototype my webpages to using it as a canvas to create SVGs for other projects as well, me and my peers have found great value in working with Figma. By working for Figma, I hope to not only learn and grow as a software engineer, but contribute to a project I use and love hoping to share that with others as well.
