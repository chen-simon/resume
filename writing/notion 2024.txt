I have used Notion before, and am very impressed with the level of quality and user friendliness that it provides. From using it to take notes in class to using it as a second brain and for group projects as well, me and my peers have found great value in working with Notion. By working for Notion, I hope to not only learn and grow as a software engineer, but contribute to a project I use and love hoping to share that with others as well.
